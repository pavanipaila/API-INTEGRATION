*Weather App* – Project Description
This Weather App is a simple and user-friendly web application that helps people check the current weather and 5-day weather forecast for any city in the world. The app is designed using basic web development tools and works directly in your web browser—no need to install anything!

*What the App Does*
The Weather App lets users:

Enter the name of a city (like "New York" or "Hyderabad").

Click a button to get the current temperature, weather condition (like sunny, rainy, or cloudy), and the 5-day forecast.

See weather icons (like sun or cloud images) to understand the forecast easily.

View the city name displayed clearly above the forecast.

*Tools and Technologies Used*
This project is made using simple web development tools that are easy to learn and very common in the tech world:

HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML is used to build the structure of the webpage. It creates the input box, buttons, and sections where the weather data is displayed.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is used to make the app look nice. It sets the background color, font style, spacing, button colors, and layout of the app so it’s clean and modern.

JavaScript
JavaScript adds functionality to the app. When you type a city name and click the button, JavaScript:

Connects to a weather service on the internet,

Gets the weather information,

Then updates the screen with the results.
It also handles errors like when the city name is not found.

OpenWeatherMap API
This is the service that gives us live weather data. API stands for “Application Programming Interface,” which means it lets our app talk to another app (in this case, OpenWeatherMap) and get real-time weather details.

*Platform*
This app is made for the web, so it can run on any device with a browser—like computers, tablets, or smartphones.

It doesn’t require a backend or database, so it’s very lightweight.

You can host this app on free platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

*Features*
Current Weather: Shows city name, temperature (in Celsius), and current weather condition.

5-Day Forecast: Shows weather for the next 5 days with icons, temperature, and description.

Responsive Design: The layout adjusts to fit different screen sizes.

City Validation: If a city name is entered wrong, it shows a helpful message.

Clean UI: Simple and modern design using white background with soft shadows and blue accents.

*What You Learn from This Project*
This project is great for beginners who want to learn:

How to build a complete project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

How to use an API to get live data from the internet.

How to update the webpage using JavaScript without reloading it.

How to organize code and keep structure clean and readable.

*Summary*
The Weather App is a fun and educational project that combines coding skills with real-world data. It teaches how to build an interactive web application from scratch, use an API, and make a useful tool that anyone can access. With a little more styling or added features like a map or hourly forecast, this app can grow into a full-fledged weather dashboard.
