## Weather App – Project Description

This Weather App is a simple and user-friendly web application that helps people check the current weather and 5-day weather forecast for any city in the world. The app is designed using basic web development tools and works directly in your web browser—no need to install anything.

---

## What the App Does

The Weather App allows users to:

- Enter the name of a city (e.g., "New York" or "Hyderabad").
- Click a button to get the current temperature, weather condition (sunny, rainy, cloudy), and 5-day forecast.
- View weather icons (like sun or cloud images) for easy understanding.
- See the city name clearly displayed above the forecast.

---

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language):**  
  Creates the input box, buttons, and sections where the weather data is shown.

- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):**  
  Styles the app—backgrounds, fonts, layout, colors, and responsiveness.

- **JavaScript:**  
  Adds interactivity:
  - Fetches weather data from a weather service.
  - Displays current and forecasted weather.
  - Handles invalid inputs or errors.

- **OpenWeatherMap API:**  
  Supplies live weather data. An API (Application Programming Interface) allows our app to communicate with OpenWeatherMap.
